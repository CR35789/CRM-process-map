# (project title) CRM Implementation Case Study

## Project Overview
**Client**: [Client or Industry Type]  
**Objective**: Describe the primary goal (e.g., "Implement a scalable CRM system to improve lead tracking and customer communication")

## Challenges

- Automated reporting for weekly sales updates
- Mapped customer journey to identify areas of improvement

## Outcomes
- **25% increase in lead conversion**
- **Time saved**: 10 hours/week on manual reporting
- **Enhanced data accuracy** with automated data capture

## Key Artifacts

- [Link to SQL Script](../Data_Analysis/SQL_Scripts/lead_conversion_analysis.sql)


# Customer Onboarding Process Map

This process map outlines the workflow for onboarding new customers, ensuring consistent follow-up and streamlined communication across departments.

## Steps
1. **Initial Contact**: Sales representative reaches out within 24 hours.
2. **Qualification**: Lead is assessed based on predefined criteria.
3. **Onboarding Call**: Scheduled within 48 hours of qualification.
4. **Data Entry**: All relevant details are entered into the CRM.

This process map helped improve onboarding time by 15% and reduced drop-offs in the early stages of the customer journey.


# Lead Conversion Analysis SQL Script

This script calculates the lead conversion rate by tracking the number of leads converted to sales each month.

```sql
SELECT 
    lead_source,
    COUNT(*) AS total_leads,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'converted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS converted_leads,
    (SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'converted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS conversion_rate
FROM
    leads
GROUP BY
    lead_source;

**Add Documentation for Tools and Comparison**

In a `Documentation` folder, include files like `CRM_Process_Optimization.md` that describe how you approach process optimization within a CRM, or `Tools_Comparison.md` comparing different CRM tools based on client needs. 

**Example Documentation** (`CRM_Process_Optimization.md`):

# CRM Process Optimization

Optimizing CRM processes involves understanding the client’s goals, mapping out existing workflows, and identifying areas for improvement.

## Key Optimization Techniques
1. **Data Cleaning**: Regularly clean and update data to ensure accuracy.
2. **Automation**: Implement automation for repetitive tasks to reduce manual workload.
3. **Integration**: Connect CRM with other systems (e.g., ERP, email) to centralize data.
4. **Reporting**: Create real-time dashboards to monitor KPIs.

These strategies improve efficiency, provide better insights, and align CRM usage with business goals.
